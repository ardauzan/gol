# GOL

A game of life implementation in Gleam!

## Purpose

One day I decided to code the game of life myself from scratch without any 3rd party libraries. I didn't know any Gleam and am doing this to learn the language and also learn the gols inner dynamics. I will check out other peoples implementations and see if I did good enough at the end. This is a learning project and not a production ready application, licensed as MIT written by me hosted here: <https://github.com/ardauzan/gol>, feel free to use it as you see fit. The development evironement is setup to be the VSCode editor with the Gleam extension, other extensions are depended upon too and should get recommended automatically when the project is opened in VSCode.

### Dependencies

1) Gleam: <https://gleam.run>, the Gleam programming language.
2) Gleam Standard Library: <https://hex.pm/packages/gleam_stdlib>, Gleam normally comes without it's standard library.
3) VSCode: <https://code.visualstudio.com>, the popular Visual Studio Code text editor.
4) Some VSCode plugins: See the .vscode/extensions.json file.

#### Setup

```sh
gleam install
```

##### Development

```sh
gleam run   # Run the project
gleam test  # Run the tests
```
